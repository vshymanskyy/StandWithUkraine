## Non-Russian companies to avoid

## ALLOW LIST (closing offices, suspending operations, etc.)
- Revolut
- Luxoft
- SAP
- JetBrains
- EPAM Systems (still unclear, their communication is lacking)

## Note!
- Please [create issues](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/StandWithUkraine/issues/new) with other products to add
- The list is still being verified. **There may be false positives,** please [create issues](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/StandWithUkraine/issues/new) to fix them
- Companies will be **moved to allow list** if there's copmelling evidence of them suspending operations in Russia
