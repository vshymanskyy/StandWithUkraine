## For Russian citizens

🇷🇺 Если вы гражданин России, ознакомьтесь сами и осознайте происходящее, пересылайте информацию своим знакомым, а также – чиновникам, местным депутатам, журналистам, семьям военнослужащих. Комментируйте в соцсетях, особенно под лживыми сообщениями, что в Украине ведется всего лишь «ограниченная военная операция» и гражданское население не страдает. Все должны знать правду!

🇺🇸 If you are a citizen of Russia, realize and understand what is happening, send information to your friends, as well as officials, local deputies, journalists, families of military personnel. Comment on social media, especially under the false reports that there is just a “limited military operation” going on in Ukraine and that civilian population is not suffering. Everyone must know the truth!
