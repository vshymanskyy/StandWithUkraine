Update from [veelenga](https://github.com/veelenga):
> Many companies suspend their business in Russia because of the agression.
I made a simple [web app](https://rblist.info) where you can quickly find the fresh list of such companies.
This shows how much the world can sacrifice to help Ukraine and to stop the war.

Update from [Tyrrrz](https://github.com/Tyrrrz):
> Kyiv or Kiev? Kharkiv or Kharkov? Mykolaiv or Nikolaev?
To make these kinds of decisions easier, I made a simple [web app](https://spellingukraine.com/) where you can quickly look up common Ukrainian names* and learn how to correctly write them in English. More on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Tyrrrz/status/1504035025200762883)

Update from [vshymanskyy](https://github.com/vshymanskyy):

> My own house is likely destroyed by Russian Forces in Irpin. The R&D lab is gone.
Our children have nowhere to return now. It's a pile of money, hard work and dedication.  
But I'm happy my family and friends are all safe. ❤️  
Irpin is a peaceful city near Kyiv. Part of the city is currently occupied by russians.
They are intentionally shooting civilians on the streets, invading and burning houses. Shops are being looted...
People are locked in their basements, limited in supplies. More on [twitter](https://twitter.com/vshymanskyy/status/1501132484062425089)
